This node.js script is designed to read a CSV file and generate an SQL `CREATE TABLE` and subsequent `INSERT` bulk queries.

It can be run in console with:
```
node app.js --path=<your-path-here>
```

Currently it looks at a premade file, counts and appends lines, and not much else. Trust me, it'll get better.
